### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was one of my favorite assignments to work on. I felt that it was more of a challenge than the other labs. It also taught me a very important skill about how to correctly use object types, which I already know will help me in the future.

* Lab 6
    
    Lab 6, part 1 was a great way to show how to accept inputs from the user. It also showed me how to integrate them into a program in a way that makes sense, as well as an intro to argument sizes, which became an important skill to know later on.

* Lab 8
    
    Lab 8, part 2 was also a fun lab to work on. This is because it taught me how to pull arguments for use in the code. It ended up being a simple solution to a problem that I initially thought would be complex, which helped me to look at general solutions for later problems, rather than convoluted ones.
